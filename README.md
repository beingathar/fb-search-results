### Usage

....

# Debugging
There are two ways to get more information and know what's happening inside the bot.

1. ``node fb.js --debug``
2. ``DEBUG=nightmare node --harmony fb.js --debug`` (on Windows use ``DEBUG=nightmare & node fb.js --debug``)

The first option shows a window of the bot working, so you can see what's doing.

The second option does the same like the previous option but this option also will give you more depth information about the bot actions.
