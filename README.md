# Installation & Setup

**This project requires to [have Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org).**

Clone the repository in your machine 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alfonbots/fb-search-results.git
$ cd fb-search-results/
```
Install the needed packages
```
$ npm install
```
Add a valid Facebook.com account
```
$ echo "user@email.com;password" > account_data.txt
```

```
$ node fb.js
```
### Usage
- **Target url**
  - The target url must follow this format: <br> [**https://m.facebook.com/search/str/**](https://m.facebook.com/search/str/keyword here/keywords_places)``keyword here``[**/keywords_places**](https://m.facebook.com/search/str/keyword here/keywords_places)
  - Example of a valid target url: **https://m.facebook.com/search/str/Bartending%2BService%2BColorado/keywords_places**
- **Adjust bot speed**
  - Depending of your machine environment you will need to increment/decrease the wait time var (``525ms`` by default)
  - An incorrect value (too low mainly) will result in less results scraped
  - You can find this variable ``var WAIT_CONST = 525`` in line [**107**](https://github.com/alfonbots/fb-search-results/blob/master/fb.js#L107)
 

# Debugging
There are two ways to get more information and know what's happening inside the bot.

1. ``node fb.js --debug``
2. ``DEBUG=nightmare node --harmony fb.js --debug`` (on Windows use ``DEBUG=nightmare & node fb.js --debug``)

The first option shows a window of the bot working, so you can see what's doing.

The second option does the same like the previous option but this option also will give you more depth information about the bot actions.
